Path: Projects/gitlet/

- Gitlet (Java)-(OOP, Trees, persistance, search algorithms, queues)

- Description:

 Built a miniature version of Git, and implemented many basic functionalities such as: init, add, merge, commit, log, find, status, and many more. This       project involved using serialization in order to preserve the current state of files.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Path: Projects/Flight Delays

- Flight Delays (Python) - (SKLearn, Numpy, Pandas, Bs4)

- Description:

Utilized Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forests, Linear Regression, PCA, Decision Trees, and Classification and Regression Trees,  
to predict whether a flight will be delayed. (SKLearn, Numpy, Pandas, Bs4)

The data in this project was pulled from a variety of different sources such as Kaggle, PageswithCode, and Github,  and was preprocessed using Pandas.

Path: Projects/DragonRepeller

- DragonRepeller - (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

- Description:

 Used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a 2-D single-player game which allow users to fight monters in order to collect money,
 level up, purchase weapons, and ultimately slay a dragon to win the game.

Path: Projects/Ataxx 

- Ataxx (Java)-(OOP, arrays, hashsets)

- Description:

 Implemented Ataxx, a two-person board game, allowing a user to play against a computer or against another 
 person, or to allow the computer to play itself. 

 Implemented the AI behind the computer player using game trees and alpha-beta pruning. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Path: Projects/Enigma

- Enigma - (Java)-(OOP, interfaces, comparables)

 This is a simulator that emulates a generalized version of the World War 2 Engima Machine. The basic functionality of the program is to 
 take in a message and encode or decode it. The encoding is done by a description of possible initial configurations which are then plugged 
 into the machine. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Path: Projects/Bugs

- Ants (Python)-(Inheritance, object-oriented programming, classes)

Description:

A game where ants and bees fight aginst each other. The parent class (insects), consists of two children classes: "ants" and "bees." Each of the
these classes have many children whose "attributes" differ from one another.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Path: Projects/Sodoku

- Sodoku (Python) - (Back-tracking)

Description:

Created a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle, by using a back-tracking algorithm, which ensures that the program
performs efficiently.
